        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want information about new 2025 natural and cruelty-free skincare products available on specific sites like Sephora, Byrdie, Allure, Soko Glam, Ulta Beauty, and Cult Beauty. The user is probably interested in the latest trends and products in the clean beauty space for the current year, 2025.\n\nFirst, I'll review the provided search results to identify relevant products. The search results include several products from Sephora, Byrdie, Cult Beauty, and Soko Glam. For example, Beauty by Earth Sunscreen Body Lotion SPF 25 (result 1) and Cay Skin Isle Glow Body Lotion SPF 45 (result 1) are mentioned as reef-safe and cruelty-free. Weleda's products (results 4 and 5) are organic and NATRUE certified, which aligns with natural skincare. SON REVE Tri-Bio Treatment Essence from Soko Glam (result 7) uses fermented ingredients and is free from harmful chemicals. Sephora's Clean at Sephora line (result 9) includes brands like ILIA and Drunk Elephant, which are known for natural and cruelty-free products. The 2025 Sephora Spring Sale favorites (result 15) mention products from Supergoop and Herbivore, which are relevant.\n\nI need to structure the report according to the given format, starting with a title and summary, followed by sections. Each section should have subsections. The mandatory sections include Title, Main Body Sections (at least 5), and Conclusion.\n\nPossible main sections could be:\n1. Innovations in Sun Protection (covering SPF lotions from Byrdie)\n2. Advances in Cleansing and Exfoliation (Weleda, Soko Glam)\n3. Hydration and Nourishment (Sephora's Clean line, Herbivore)\n4. Ethical Certifications and Sustainability (NATRUE, Clean at Sephora)\n5. Emerging Trends and Brands (Thrive Causemetics, ILIA Beauty)\n\nEach section needs detailed subsections. For example, under Sun Protection, discuss reef-safe formulations, new SPF lotions, and user testimonials. Under Certifications, talk about NATRUE, Clean at Sephora, and vegan formulations.\n\nI must ensure all cited products are from the given search results and cite them correctly using brackets. Check each product's details against the results to confirm they're 2025 releases. For instance, result 1 mentions testing in 2025, so those products are new. Weleda's products might not be new but are relevant as natural options. The 2025 Sephora Sale items (result 15) are recent.\n\nI also need to avoid lists and use paragraphs, integrating all information smoothly. Mentioning key ingredients, brand ethos, and product benefits while citing sources. For example, Beauty by Earth uses zinc oxide and natural moisturizers [1], Cay Skin has sea moss and cocoa butter [1], and SON REVE uses fermented ingredients [7].\n\nEnsure the report is comprehensive, around 10,000 words, but since the platform has limitations, focus on depth within each section. Check that all sources are correctly cited and that the report adheres to academic tone without lists or bullet points.\n</think>\n{ \"trends\": [ { \"section\": \"Introduction\", \"content\": \"The beauty industry in 2025 has witnessed a paradigm shift towards natural and ethical formulations, with Sephora, Cult Beauty, and specialty retailers leading the charge.
